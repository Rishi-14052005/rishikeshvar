 ## About Me
 I am Rishi, a pre-final year student at BITS Hyderabad pursuing a dual degree in Mechanical Engineering(B.E) and Biological Sciences (M.Sc). You can find about my past and on-going projects on this website. My blogs are mostly personal opinions, but you may also find some research centric blogs about the human brain.

 ## Projects I have worked on / currently working on
 1. Student's Anonymous
 2. Spectrum Edventures
 3. HowToCrackInterviews
 4. W&H
 5. One month with Ankur Warikoo
 6. Case competitions in college
 7. Zenskar
 8. NeoVes (on going)
 9. Research Intern at APU (on going)
 10. Research Intern at BITS (on going)

 I hope to research the human brain to understand mental health, trauma, neurological disorders and contribute in the reduction of suffering.

 ## More about me
 Reading, writing and the gym is my definition of self care and good health. In April 2025 I started learning hindustani classical music. I hope to sing decently well some day. 
 I also understand that life is short and we are not going to be here forever and nothing great can be done alone. I hope to collaborate to reduce sufferring by pursuing research in mental health, human behavior, and spend most of time writing and teaching.
